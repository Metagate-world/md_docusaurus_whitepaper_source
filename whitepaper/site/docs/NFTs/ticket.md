# One Ticket TWO NFTs

You can get Aetherya NFTs through tickets. Tickets are NFTs themselves and you can resell them before use. Each ticket will sell at the same price and will be burnt for two NFTs: one [property](/docs/NFTs/property) and one [avatar](/docs/NFTs/avatar).

See the rarities of properties and avatars in [NFTokenomics](/docs/NFTs/nftokenomics). When you mint your ticket, you will see which category the NFTs will fall into.

## Whitelisting

Whitelisting requires registering on the [Metagate App](https://app.metagate.world/) and joining our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/metagate). After completing the tasks, candidates can mint their tickets on the Metagate App.

Sales price will be USDT 500 or ETH 0.16 per ticket.

But watch out!

There will be immediate whitelisting for some of the first to register. And there are a limited number of tickets (as there are limited number of properties) â€” see the [NFTokenomics](/docs/NFTs/nftokenomics).
